# Risk Universe

This 'risk universe' is a framework for information security risk professionals to explore, analyse and communicate cyber risk.

## Matrix

This tabular quick-reference of the risk universe is currently (very) incomplete, but is provided as a visual aid:

| Threat                                 | Event              | Outcome            | Asset              | Loss                                   |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| [Accidental](/threat/accidental)       |                    | Data Breach        | Personal Info.     | [Productivity](/loss/productivity)     |
| [Coerced](/threat/coerced)             |                    |                    |                    | Etc...                                 |

## Risk Statements

This risk universe can be used to construct risk scenarios like:

_There is a **probability** that **threat** causes **event** resulting in **outcome** to **asset** of **loss**._

The risk universe is constructed around these building blocks that are accessible via the menu on the left.

### Probability

Probabilities will vary dramatically by organisation and so are expressed as factors that increase, or decrease, the contact frequency or probability of action for a **[threat](/threat)** or the resistance strength against an **[event](/event)**.

### Threat

**[Threats](/threat)** are the sources that eventually cause an **[event](/event)** to occur.

### Event

**[Events](/event)** are the set of conditions that need to be met in order for the risk scenario to result in the **[outcome](/outcome)**.

### Outcome

**[Outcomes](/outcome)** are broad classes of scenario that an organisation may concern itself with and that affect an **[asset](/asset)** and will result in **[loss](/loss)** of one or more types.

### Asset

**[Assets](/asset)** are the 'crown jewels' that an organisation wishes to protect from harm.

### Loss

**[Loss](/loss)** is the ultimate (negative) impact suffered by the organisation.
