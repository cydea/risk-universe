# Information Risk Universe

This information risk 'universe' is a framework for information security risk professionals to explore, analyse and communicate cyber risk.

It [serves a variety of purposes](/summary/use-cases/) and can be used to [construct and explore good risk statements](/summary/risk-statements/) in the format:

_There is a **probability** that **threat** causes **event** resulting in **outcome** to **asset** of **loss**._

It was originally created from work by [Phil Huggins](https://twitter.com/oracuk) and [Robin Oldham](https://twitter.com/rto) and is now maintained by a group of [contributors](/about/contribute/).

It is available as an open-source tool for the information security community to (re)use. See [the license](/about/license/) for more information.
