# Asset

Assets are the 'crown jewels' that an organisation wishes to protect from harm. They many be the target for, or collateral damage of, a [threat](/threat). Assets have value to their organisation and [outcomes](/outcome) lead to [losses](/loss).

It is important that an organisation regularly ask itself _what are we defending?_

Identifying and maintaining asset inventories is a complex activity and the primary objective of this risk universe is not to create an exhaustive list of unique assets. Rather, this is to stimulate thought of different classes of asset, how your organisation uses those assets, and who may be interested in those assets.
