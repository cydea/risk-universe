_'To err is human'_. We all make mistakes and the staff of an organisation may accidentally be the source of information security risk.

## Motivations

By their very nature accidental insiders do not have explicit motivations rather they may be the victims of circumstances such as:

- Lack of understanding
- Increased pressure

It is important to remember that organisational culture can result in accidental insiders trying to hide their mistake and avoid repercussions. This can slow the detection, and response to the event.

## Factors

The following factors may increase, or decrease, the frequency with which an organisation comes into contact with this threat, or the probability that the threat will result in action.
