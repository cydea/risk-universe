# Risk Statements

This information risk universe is constructed around these building blocks:

_There is a **probability** that **threat** causes **event** resulting in **outcome** to **asset** of **loss**._

You can [use these blocks](/summary/use-cases) to construct a risk scenario, for example:

 `[TODO: Confirm these all map/link to the parts of the RU.] There is a 20-30% probability that criminals cause a ransomware infection resulting in an outage to business operations and loss of £10,000-£50,000.`

In each part of the universe we describe the building block, what makes it unique, factors that affect the level of risk and provide links to examples.

This format is based upon _[writing a good risk statement](http://blog.blackswansecurity.com/2018/02/writing-a-good-risk-statement/)_ by Phil Huggins.


## Probability

Probabilities will vary dramatically by organisation and so are expressed as factors that increase, or decrease, the contact frequency or probability of action for a **[threat](/threat)** or the resistance strength against an **[event](/event)**.

## Threat

**[Threats](/threat)** are the sources that eventually cause an **[event](/event)** to occur.

## Event

**[Events](/event)** are the set of conditions that need to be met in order for the risk scenario to result in the **[outcome](/outcome)**.

## Outcome

**[Outcomes](/outcome)** are broad classes of scenario that an organisation may concern itself with and that affect an **[asset](/asset)** and will result in **[loss](/loss)** of one or more types.

## Asset

**[Assets](/asset)** are the 'crown jewels' that an organisation wishes to protect from harm.

## Loss

**[Loss](/loss)** is the ultimate (negative) impact suffered by the organisation.
