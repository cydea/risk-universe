Security researchers are inquisitive individuals or groups with an aim to identify an improve security weaknesses in organisations.

They may do this by explicitly undertaking external research using automated tools or manual techniques to understand the security posture of an organisation. They may be customers who identify vulnerabilities while interacting with the organisation.

In less mature organisations security researchers may be confused with [criminals](/threat/criminal) or [hacktivists](/threat/hacktivist).

## Motivations

Security researchers are motivated by:

- Improving security posture
- Financial gain (bug bounties)
- Bragging rights
